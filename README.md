# Text Tools

This is a small tool for de- and encoding Text. It's similar to the Decoder Tab found in Burp.
The main goal is to be able to create pipelines and easily share them via the URL.

# Building and Debugging

Run `npm i && npm run build` to build into the `dist` directory.

Vue also has a hot reload feature which is very useful when debugging.
Use `npm run serve` to start the development server.

# TODOs

- Add an IntelliJ-like **Search everywhere** to easily add/remove items from the pipeline.
- Add a **better Pipeline-Add menu**.
- Add a **small pipeline view** next to the "Edit Pipeline" button.
- Ability to **set the delay** between the input and output.
